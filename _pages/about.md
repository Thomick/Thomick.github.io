I am currently a PhD student in the Scool team at Inria on the topic: "Responsible Reinforcement Learning: Robustness and Privacy for & by Sequential Decision Making". My PhD supervisors are Émilie Kaufmann and Debabrota Basu. Previously, I graduated from École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay, where I specialized in artificial intelligence and machine learning. I am particularly interested in developing intelligent systems that work for and with humans to address real-world challenges, and in exploring the fundamental nature of intelligence.

My research experiences acquired through several internships span various domains within AI:

- Emergence, control and open-ended evolution in cellular automata (INRIA Bordeaux, FLOWERS team)
- Agricultural decision-making under environmental risks (INRIA Lille, SCOOL team)
- Image restoration through real noise modeling (Centre Borelli, ENS Paris-Saclay)
- Algorithms for satisficing in reinforcement learning (University of Leoben)
- Computational models for human multiple object tracking (INRIA Bordeaux, FLOWERS team)
