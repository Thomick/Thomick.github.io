## Bio

I am a graduate student at École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay, specializing in artificial intelligence and machine learning. My academic focus includes deep learning, computer vision, reinforcement learning, and mathematical modeling. I am particularly interested in developing AI solutions that address real-world challenges and exploring the fundamental nature of intelligence.

My research experiences span various domains within AI:

- Emergence, control and open-ended evolution in cellular automata (INRIA Bordeaux, FLOWERS team)
- Agricultural decision-making under environmental risks (INRIA Lille, SCOOL team)
- Image restoration through real noise modeling (Centre Borelli, ENS Paris-Saclay)
- Algorithms for satisficing in reinforcement learning (University of Leoben)
- Computational models for human multiple object tracking (INRIA Bordeaux, FLOWERS team)

## Projects

Find my past project report (research internship and master) on [this page]({{ base_path }}/reports).

Also, check out my Github profile [here](https://github.com/Thomick) for some other past and current coding projects.
I will make sure to present them properly on this website soon, maybe with other fun things.
